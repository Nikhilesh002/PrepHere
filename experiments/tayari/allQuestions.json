If he skips the amount which he needs pay then due will be one, one next day user requested 100 and paid 100 then due will one because the previous day he didnt paid right so due will be one. attaching the details below.\nInput - demand,collection, demanddate,collectiondate \n   100 100 2025010120250101 \n  100 100 20250102 20250102 \n  100 0 20250103 20250103 \n  100 100 20250104 20250104 \n  100 0 20250105 20250105 \n  100 300 20250106 20250106 . \noutput - \ndemand,collection, demanddate,collectiondate, due \n   100 100 2025010120250101 0\n  100 100 20250102 20250102 0\n  100 0 20250103 20250103 1\n  100 100 20250104 20250104 1\n  100 0 20250105 20250105 2\n  100 300 20250106 20250106 0. \n\nSummary of the question if user paid the demanded amount the due will be 0, if user skips amount the due will be 1, due will increase as days will increase if wont pay, user skips for two days then due will 2(5 row). if user paid all the due amount then due will become zero(last row).",

However, there's a cost involved each time you connect two ropes, and the cost is equal to the combined length of those two ropes. Your task is to find a way to connect all the ropes while minimizing the total cost.\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\nInitial array: {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}\n1. Combine the two smallest ropes (1 and 2):\n    * Cost = 1 + 2 = 3\n    * Updated array after combining: {5, 4, 3, 3}\n2. Combine the two smallest ropes (3 and 3):\n    * Cost = 3 + 3 = 6\n    * Updated array after combining: {5, 4, 6}\n3. Combine the two smallest ropes (4 and 5):\n    * Cost = 4 + 5 = 9\n    * Updated array after combining: {6, 9}\n4. Combine the remaining ropes (6 and 9):\n    * Cost = 6 + 9 = 15\n    * Updated array: {15}\nNow we have combined all the ropes into one, so the total cost is the sum of all the individual combination costs:\nTotal cost = 3 + 6 + 9 + 15 = 33\n\nExamples 2:\nInput: arr[] = {4,3,2,6} , \nOutput: 29",
